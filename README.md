A Tensorflow implementation of [DRAW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623)

This is code to accompany [my post on the DRAW model](http://kvfrans.com/what-is-draw-deep-recurrent-attentive-writer/).

It's just a slightly re-written and commented version of [ericjang's implementation](https://github.com/ericjang/draw).

Usage:
```
python main.py
```
